### FULL OUTER JOIN
/*
1. Say you're an analyst at Parch & Posey and you want to see:

 - each account who has a sales rep and each sales rep that has an account (all
 of the columns in these returned rows will be full)
 - but also each account that does not have a sales rep and each sales rep that
 does not have an account (some of the columns in these returned rows will be empty)

This type of question is rare, but FULL OUTER JOIN is perfect for it. In the
following SQL Explorer, write a query with FULL OUTER JOIN to fit the above
described Parch & Posey scenario (selecting all of the columns in both of the
relevant tables, accounts and sales_reps) then answer the subsequent multiple
choice quiz.

### UNION
/*
1. Write a query that uses UNION ALL on two instances (and selecting all
columns) of the accounts table. Then inspect the results and answer the
subsequent quiz.
